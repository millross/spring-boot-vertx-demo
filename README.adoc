# Spring Boot calling vert.x demo

A small demo of a spring boot application calling vert.x
Showing (via logging at info level) which threads are used for which
parts of the logic (in particular that you can wrap the eventbus in
blocking code via CompletableFuture while leaving the vert.x side
of the eventbus entirely non-blocking and asynchronous).
